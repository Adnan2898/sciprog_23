This Readme file is for the Practical 06.
Here we learnt a few things based on Matrix.
In the Main function present in the Practical06 file, we see that the code to initiate the matrix is given where two matrices
A and B of a set size are given. We are to multiply them and find their multiplication.

We see that the number of columns of A are to be equal with B for this multiplication to be valid. The size of the result will be
rows of A x Columns of B

The file is then executed. The CODE is mentioned with the necessary comments


The other files mentioned are matmult.c

This has a function where the whole code is executed in such a manner that we can call this file without having to write code in the mainfile


Laslty we have a makfile which will directly compile these codes together without us creating a <file>.o file everytime. This redundant step is avoided and we
can directly make the changes in the code and accordingly run them.
